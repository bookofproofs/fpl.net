# Landau's Foundations of Analysis

This is a formulation of Edmund Landau's "Foundations of Analysis" (1930 Leipzig) in FPL (the Formal Proving Language).
In fact, Landau deals in this work with the axiomatic foundation of arithmetics, starting from natural numbers and ending with complex numbers.

The namespace Fpl.Arithmetics serves as a "proof of concept" for the language, while formulating Landau's work in FPL.
Some comments in FPL are used to have a immediate comparison between the spoken formulation of the theorems and proofs and their formulation in FPL.

We keep Landau's original  numbering of theorems and axioms the same for better reference purposes.
