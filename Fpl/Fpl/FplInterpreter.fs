/// This module contains the main program of the FPL interpreter
/// It makes sure that all uses clauses are loaded and parsed before the SymbolTable can be created out of the AST.
/// It also catches any unexpected runtime errors to make sure that the FPL Language Server never crashes. 
/// In case an expected runtime error is produced, the Language Server will emit a GEN00 diagnostics.
