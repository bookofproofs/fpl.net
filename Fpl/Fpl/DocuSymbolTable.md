# Documentation of the FPL Symbol Table
## What is the FPL Symbol Table
The symbol table (ST) is a pivotal data structure that the FPL interpreter constructs while traversing the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the FPL parser. It is a dynamic structure that undergoes state changes during the traversal. The FPL interpreter leverages the current state of the ST to emit diagnostics as it traverses the AST, making it an integral part of the interpreter's operation.

## Goal of this document
This document focuses on the ST's dynamic aspects and state changes that are not apparent from the code.

## Global Structure of the ST 
The F# type `SymbolTable` is defined in the `FplInterpreterTypes` module. It is a recursive tree structure of the F# type `FplValue` defined in the same module. Each node of the ST is of the `FplValue` type but can have different purposes and attributions. One such key attribution is the `FplValueType` of each node. For instance, the ST starts with a `FplValueType.Root` node. Each of the `FplValue` nodes of the ST tree has two sequences - `Scope` and `ValueList`, which may contain further `FplValue` nodes with a different `FplValuType`. This structure is essential to understand the organization and functionality of the ST.

## How to read this Description of the ST
Since the ST is constructed during the AST traversal, it depends on the AST types being traversed. The titles of the following sections will be titled by concatenating the `FplValueType`s of the nodes of the ST, that are constructed 

### ST.Root
**Description**: The root of the ST

**Created in**: In `FplInterpreterTypes.SymbolTable` constructor

**Output**: 
```
	Root
	|-Name: ""
	|-Parent: None
	|-Scope: <empty>
	|-ValueList: <empty>
```

### ST.Root.Theory
**Created in**: In `FplInterpreterBuildingBlocks.evaluateSymbolTable` loop over all theories 

**Output (parent)**: 
```
	Root
	|-Name: ""
	|-Parent: None
	|-Scope: Contains a non-empty <string,FplValue> dictionary of all here created Theory nodes
	|-ValueList: <empty>
```

**Output**: 
```
	Theory
	|-Name: <NameSpaceName>
	|-Parent: Some Root
	|-Scope: Contains a (possibly) empty <string,FplValue> dictionary of all FPL blocks inside this theory
	|-ValueList: <empty>
```

### ST.Root.Theory.Class
**Created in**: In `FplInterpreterBuildingBlocks.eval | Ast.DefinitionClass`

**Output (parent)**: 
```
	Root
	|-Name: ""
	|-Parent: None
	|-Scope: Contains a non-empty <string,FplValue> dictionary of all here created Theory nodes
	|-ValueList: Contains (a possibly empty) list of nodes, from which the class
		inherits. These can be class nodes or primitive objects. The values are
		only added if they were previously declared in the code.
```

**Created at traversal**: `AST.Namespace.DefinitionClass`

* *Context*: `InSignature` - here, the ValueList gets constructed 
* *Context*: `InBlock` - here, the ValueList gets constructed and all variables, constructors and properties of the class declared in the block are added to the Scope of the class.
